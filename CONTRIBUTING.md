# Contributing to Veil

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Veil. This project prioritizes clarity, safety, and auditability.

## Git workflow

- The `main` branch is always releasable and reflects reviewed work.
- Create a feature branch for each change or topic.
- Open a PR when the feature branch is ready for review.
- Rebase or merge from `main` as needed to keep your branch current.

## Commit message conventions

- Use a short, imperative summary line.
- Prefix with a scope when useful, for example: `docs:`, `kernel:`, `arch:`.
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
- Example: `docs: add initial roadmap`.

## Commit size and auditability

- Prefer small, focused commits that are easy to review.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in the same commit.
- Document rationale in the commit body when the change is non-trivial.

## Code style

No code style rules are enforced yet. This will be introduced after the initial bring-up phases.
